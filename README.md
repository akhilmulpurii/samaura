## âœ¨ Overview

**SAMAURA** is a clean, modern Jellyfin client built with **Vite+React.js** â€” designed for speed, simplicity, and elegance.  
It builds upon the solid foundation of **[Finetic](https://github.com/AyaanZaveri/finetic)** while introducing extended functionality and removing unnecessary complexity.

Special Thanks to **[@AyaanZaveri](https://github.com/AyaanZaveri)**, this is based on his work on finetic, but I am building it upon my personal preferences.

### ðŸ”¹ Whatâ€™s New in SAMAURA

- **Simplified Experience** â€“ Removed AI dependencies for a faster, lighter client, as I personally would not use them at all.
- **Migrated to Vite** - The Entire Project is migrated into Vite + React, since Vite is much faster than webpack and we dont really need SSR features for an application like this.
- **Collections Support** â€“ Full integration for browsing and playing box sets
- **Live TV (WIP)** â€“ Live TV currently works partially, Channels populate but a guide and programs page must be integrated.
- **Improved Navigation & Performance** â€“ Cleaner architecture and optimized loading
- **Theming Enhancements** â€“ Liquid Glass like Theme coming soon
- **Using Tauri instead of Electron** â€“ Now native apps will be based on tauri for better performance, especially with Vite + React + Tauri
